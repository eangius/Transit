    "\\[⚙️1]: To avoid the curse of high dimensionality from one-hot-encoding categorical features that are cyclical in nature, we can instead trigonometrically encode these with only 2 features per signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[⚙️2]: ``H3`` or ``Geohash`` are geo-indexing schemes that let you navigate to nested & neighbouring areas quickly. They group various *lat,lng* points to the same hash area helping transfer learn areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[⚙️3]: Use of ``LSTM`` or ``Transformer`` architectures is recommended. Unlike classical machine learned algorithms like ``RandomForestRegressor`` or ``XGBRegressor``, these are deep learned recurrent neural networks that leverage the sequential structure of  data. Care must be taken to only model forward uni-directionality of data to avoid *data leackage* from learning with future unavailable data at production time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[⚙️4]: Since data is plentiful, we recommend ``NearMiss`` down sampling the majority classes which ignores easy to predict data. However, we can also employ ``SMOTE`` techniques to synthesize artifical datapoints for the minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[⚙️5]: Scaling the collection of signals before learning ensures all features are weighted equaly despite their units or magnitude ranges.\n",
