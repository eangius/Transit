    "\\[⚙️1]: To avoid the curse of high dimensionality from one-hot-encoding categorical features that are cyclical in nature, we can instead trigonometrically encode these with only 2 features per signal.\n",

    "\n",
    "\\[⚙️3]: Use of ``LSTM`` or ``Transformer`` architectures is recommended. Unlike classical machine learned algorithms like ``RandomForestRegressor`` or ``XGBRegressor``, these are deep learned recurrent neural networks that leverage the sequential structure of  data. Care must be taken to only model forward uni-directionality of data to avoid *data leakage* from learning with future unavailable data at production time.\n",

    "\\[⚙️5]: Scaling the collection of signals before learning ensures all features are weighted equally despite their units or magnitude ranges.\n",

Likewise we don't want model to train on end of day data when asked to predict start of day. Both cases lead model to \"memorize\" answer in the lab that it will not have in production. So must ensure spatial or temporal splits of route data do not occur.\n",
